# OTPSolver
The Australian Cyber Security Growth Network had a CTF during September 2017. 
One of the challenges was to find the One Time Pin to login into their network using Time Based One Time Pin algorithm and they base 32 key '44KKCPXF6WT772ZK'.
TOTPCalc.py is the code I used to solve that challenge. I'm putting it up on github for 2 reasons:
1. I don't have to redo it sometime in future
2. Have an excuse to practice my python
